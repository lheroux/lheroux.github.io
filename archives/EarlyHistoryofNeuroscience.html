      I was listening to a song by Simon and Garfunkel that referenced the brain. This made me think about the usage of the word brain to talk about the self, about the feelings. I instinctively feel like it is counterintuitive to talk about an organ to refer to feelings and consciousness. I wanted to understand when we started to use the brain to talk about such things, as humans. This led me to an interesting article on the history of neuroscience. Although it is mainly focused on western neuroscience (lacking knowledge from eastern tradition), it is interesting. <a href="../Hist_Neurosci_Ency_neurosci.pdf" target="_blank">Here is the article</a>.
